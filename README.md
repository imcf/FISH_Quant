# FISH-quant #

Matlab toolbox to analyze single molecule mRNA FISH data. Allows counting the number of mature and nascent transcripts in 3D images.

For more details see the publication: Mueller F, Senecal A, Tantale K, Marie-Nelly H, Ly N, Collin O, Basyuk E, Bertrand E, Darzacq X, Zimmer C. FISH-quant: automatic counting of transcripts in 3D FISH images. Nature Methods 2013; 10(4): 277–278.

### Installation information ###
Program was developed and tested in Matlab R2014a on Mac OS 10.9.5. Some functions might NOT work in earlier versions. Please contact us if you encounter any problems.

The following toolboxes are required

* Optimization toolbox
* Statistics toolbox
* Image processing toolbox
* (Optional) Parallel processing toolbox 

Program is provided as an ZIP archive. On rare occasions problems might occur when unzipping under Windows 7 with the built-in unzipper. Here the folders are encrypted and are shown in green. This can be avoided by using the free program 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/). 

### Getting started ###
We provide several files to help new user getting used to FISH-quant. We recommend working with the example data and using either step-by-step tutorial or the video tutorials to familiarize yourself with the basic functionality. The more detailed user manual can then be used to adjust more advanced options.

* Example data. This zip archive contains already processed FISH data. For these data the entire analysis has been performed and the different results files are provided.
* Tutorial PDF. In this PDF we explain in detail the basic workflow for the analysis of FISH data. This is done based on the example data.
* User manual. A PDF containing with a detailed user manual describing the entire functionality of FISH-quant. 

### Development team ###
Developed by Florian MUELLER (Institut Pasteur,ENS Paris) and Aubin SAMACOITS (Institut Pasteur) based on work of Hervé Marie-Nelly (Institut Pasteur). 

### Depot at APP ###
A depot of the software was issued at APP (http://www.app.asso.fr/en/) under the reference number IDDN.FR.001.090009.000.S.A.2013.000.10000
