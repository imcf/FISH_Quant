FISH-quant




Program is provided as an ZIP archive. On rare occasions problems might occur when unzipping under Windows 7 with the built-in unzipper. Here the folders are encrypted and are shown in green. This can be avoided by using the free program 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/).
Getting started

We provide several files to help new user getting used to FISH-quant. We recommend working with the example data and using either step-by-step tutorial or the video tutorials to familiarize yourself with the basic functionality. The more detailed user manual can then be used to adjust more advanced options.

    Example data. This zip archive contains already processed FISH data. For these data the entire analysis has been performed and the different results files are provided.
    Tutorial: PDF. In this PDF we explain in detail the basic workflow for the analysis of FISH data. This is done based on the example data.
    Tutorial: Videos. In the Wiki section we provide several videos that explain the basic workflow. They contain similar information as the Tutorial. However, they might not show some of the most recent changes after an update of FISH-quant.
    User manual. An PDF containing with a detailed user manual describing the entire functionality of FISH-quant.
